But diving in can still be intimidating, so why not join a group of people doing the same thing in a supportive environment? Comics for Anybody will be just that: you will be making your own work, however you want to, but with guidance on how to start and how to keep going. We will share            ideas and troubleshoot and support each other. The only things you need are an idea, your preferred writing and drawing tools, and a desire to start. You’re an anybody, you can do it!</p><p>Instructor Bio: Violet Austerlitz transplanted herself from Missouri to Iowa City five years ago with no plan, and she’s quite confident that it was a good idea. She studied printmaking at Truman State University, focusing             on silkscreen and letterpress, and has kept up her art practice as a member of the Iowa City Press Co-op. She also writes and draws a webcomic called The Satanic Mechanic.</p>",
